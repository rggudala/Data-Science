# Ukraine War Twitter Polarization: SimpleRNN (49%)

Many countries are supporting Ukraine by introducing economic sanctions on Russia. There are a lot of tweets about the Ukraine and Russia war where people tend to update about the ground truths, what they feel about it, and who they are supporting.

Share of contradictory tweets daily. Lower is 'less polarized discourse': Tweets are measured against each other and analyzed with a model trained with SimpleRNN on a Standord Natural Language Inference Dataset.

Notable events lead to lower polarization:

July 29 - 38.4% --Olenivka prison attack
August 9 - 43.2% --Crimea Russian base attack
August 24 - 39.5% -- Ukraine Independence Day
October 2 - 41.0% --Annexation of certain territories
October 11 - 46.1% -- Russian terror attacks on Kyiv
Generally polarization seems to be trending down.

FYI: The dataset that I am using for the task on the Ukraine and Russia War is downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was initially collected from Twitter and is updated regularly.
